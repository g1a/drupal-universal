# Composer-enabled Drupal template

This is an experimental upstream forked from the [Drupal (Composer Managed)](https://github.com/pantheon-upstreams/drupal-composer-managed) upstream. This upstream starts with the latest stable release of [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), and then updates the dependency constraints in the composer.json file to prevent upgrades to new major releases that may come out later.
